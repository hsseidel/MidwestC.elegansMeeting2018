## Registration

Attendees must [register](https://ebill.emich.edu/C20704_ustores/web/classic/store_main.jsp?STOREID=56&SINGLESTORE=true){:target="_blank"} for the meeting. The registration deadline is March 24th. The registration fee is $20 and includes lunch.

## Abstract submission

Meeting attendees are invited to [submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfz9m_OCeO5EX0NN2tp35ftZxYpwJbc2ufpcnqs-P3b-ddtjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link){:target="_blank"} abstracts for posters and oral presentations. We will do our best to accomodate all requests for oral presentations. We especially encourage oral presentations from undergrads and grad students, as well as faculty new to the Midwest *C. elegans* Meeting.

Abstracts should represent original work and be no more than 300 words long.

All abstracts must be submitted by March 24th.

## Poster Guidelines

~~Posters should be no larger than 60” wide by 42” high.~~

Posters will be mounted to foam boards, ~60" x 42" in size. The boards can be rotated in either direction (i.e. long-direction vertical or long-direction horizontal). For those of you who have posters slightly larger than 42" in the short dimension, it is acceptable for the poster to hang off the board by a few inches.

## Equipment for Oral Presentations

Please provide your presentation on a thumb drive, to be loaded onto a Macbook with a full install of Microsoft Office 2017.
