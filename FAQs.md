##I've never heard of Eastern Michigan University. Tell me more.
Eastern Michigan University is a regional public university located in Ypsilanti, MI. EMU serves students from all over the world, but most EMU students come from Michigan and nearby states. EMU gained its first *C. elegans* lab when Hannah Seidel joined the Biology Department in 2016. The Biology Department now uses *C. elegans* in one of its core labs for biology majors.

##How big should my poster be?
Posters should be no larger than [??]” wide by [??]” high.

##How long should my talk be?
We will determine the length of oral presentations once we know the number of requests for talks. For now, we estimate that we will allocate ~15 min to each talk.

##Should I do a practice talk before the meeting?
YES! YES! YES! Please, please practice your talk several times before giving it. Ideally, you should practice your talk for your lab and make any changes they suggest. As you create your talk, keep in mind that your audience at the meeting includes many people who are unfamiliar with your area of research. Craft your talk to reach everyone in the audience. If your talk feels rushed, cut some slides. Teach less and the audience will learn more.

##What is the history of the Midwest *C. elegans* meeting?
The Midwest *C. elegans* meeting started in 2013 at Hope College in Holland, MI. The meeting later moved to the Van Andel Research Institute in Grand Rapids, MI. This year the meeting will be held at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, MI. In future years, the meeting might stay at Eastern Michigan University or it might move to a new location. If you are interested in hosting the meeting at your institution, please contact Hannah Seidel (*hseidel* at *emich.edu*) or Erika Sorensen (*sorensee* at *wabash.edu*)

##Why do I have to pay a registration fee? Last time the meeting was free.
We sincerely wish we could offer the meeting for free. Unfortunately, EMU does not have funds to cover the cost of the meeting. We are doing our best to find sponsorship to cover the meeting cost.

##Will I get any microscopy tips at the meeting?
Yes! The Seidel Lab will demo their DIY epifluorescence dissecting scope. This scope works great for following balancer chromosomes and was building by adding ~$100 worth of LEDs and filters to a standard dissecting scope. This scope is currently being used by EMU undergrad Reem Yassine for her senior thesis. In addition to the scope, the Seidel Lab will bring a list of parts and suppliers in case you want to build a similar scope of your own.

##How do you pronounce "Ypsilanti"?
Ypsilanti is pronounced *ip-si-LAN-tee*. Locals call it Ypsi (*IP-see*) for short.

##Will I see any nationally ranked, historic landmarks at the meeting?
Yes! The meeting is located across the street from the [Ypsilanti Water Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypsilanti_Water_Tower), a historic landmark that won [this award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_Phallic_Building_contest).

##I'd to stay in Ypsilanti for dinner. Where should I eat?
Locals recommend [Sidetrack Bar & Grill](http://www.sidetrackbarandgrill.com/), especially for its sweet potato fries. Other recommendations are [The Wurst Bar](http://wurstbarypsi.com/) and [ABC Microbrewery](http://www.arborbrewing.com/).
